This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website/blog for Dr. James Landreth, a retired doctor who is an avid traveler, photographer, and writer. The main challenge is displaying hundreds of beautifully formatted Microsoft Word documents (converted to PDF) on his WordPress blog while maintaining their professional appearance and readability.

## Content Profile

- **Author**: Retired doctor with extensive travel and photography experience
- **Content type**: Essays, family newsletters, travel journals, and personal narratives
- **Source format**: Microsoft Word documents with professional formatting, images, and layouts
- **Current format**: PDFs generated from Word documents
- **Target platform**: WordPress blog integration

## Document Characteristics

Based on sample documents:
- **Family newsletters**: "Les Nouvelles de Famille" style annual updates with photos and detailed family stories
- **Travel journals**: "Our Journal of the Plague Year" documenting experiences and adventures
- **Professional formatting**: Multi-column layouts, integrated images, consistent typography
- **Rich content**: Personal narratives, historical references, cultural observations

## Content Categories

The website covers diverse topics including:
- Health, Fashion, Food, Shopping, Events
- Fiction, Travel (especially Japan), Education  
- Family History, Photography, Music
- Annual Adventures, Personal Essays

## Technical Challenge

**Primary goal**: Convert beautifully formatted Word/PDF documents into web-friendly format for WordPress while preserving:
- Professional layout and typography
- Image placement and formatting
- Readability and visual appeal
- Consistent styling across hundreds of documents

## Current State

The repository contains basic HTML/CSS files that appear to be early development work, not reflecting the actual WordPress blog structure shown in the live site.

## Development Considerations

- **Content migration**: Need system to convert PDF/Word content to WordPress posts
- **Formatting preservation**: Maintain visual quality of original documents
- **Image handling**: Properly display and optimize photos from original documents
- **Navigation**: Organize hundreds of documents by category and chronology
- **Responsive design**: Ensure documents display well on all devices
