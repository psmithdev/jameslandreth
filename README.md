Version 1 was a simple WordPress setup.  Became painful overtime with too many plugins full of bloat.  Hosting did not get renewed and only had a few older backups to restore from.

Version 2 was Wix.  A slight improvement, still pain to get going.  My problem with WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) web design programs is they limit creativity.  Here is a box and a few tools, have fun and dont you dare step outside your box.

After learning some basic HTML and CSS on my own, my next attempt is full autonomy and see what I can do on my own.  Time to fire up VS code and get to work.
